# Project 5 - Restaurant Reveiew App

This is the fifth project in the Front End Web Development Nanodegeree by Udacity.

## Description

A site was already created and downloaded for use.  The downloaded code had many issues making it not pleasant for the end user.  Our main tasts were the following:

  1) Procure, and use a MapBox API key to generate maps on the page.
  1) Make the site responsive, for all display sizes.  
  2) Make the site accessible by applying ARIA concepts.
  3) Cache the site for offline use.
  
## Instructions

1) Clone the repo, and start a python server by running `python -m http.server 8000`
2) Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
